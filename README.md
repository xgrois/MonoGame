MonoGame simple projects

[[1] **ConsoleAppWithMonogame.**](ConsoleAppWithMonogame)  This is a .NET 5 console app (not using a MonoGame template) that adds MonoGame as a nuget package.
MonoGame does not provide shapes so in this sample we create some helpful classes to draw simple "line shapes" (line, circle, convex regular polygons) easier and
without the need of the content manager tool.
